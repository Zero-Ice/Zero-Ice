        <a href="https://riichitools.web.app/play">Riichi Tools(Mahjong What Would You Do?)(My first web project)</a>
        <p>During year 1 of university, I got into Riichi Mahjong and I was searching forums for guides and asking what people would discard for a certain hand. 
        I figured it would be fun to create a one stop webapp where users play this minigame, but with features such as the ability to cycle through hands quickly and easily with little clicks; and always see statistics on what other people discard.
        I started learning web development with this as my first project</p>
        What the app does
        <ul>
            <li>Create their own hands, button to generate a code for others to play</li>
            <li>In play mode, retrieve a random hand from database, or generate a newly random hand</li>
            <li>User vote their preferred tile to discard</li>
            <li>Results shown after voting. Results can be seen without voting</li>
            <li>User can choose to proceed to next hand</li>
        </ul>
        What i think i could have done better
        <ul>
            <li>Better UI (Jank padding, margins because of little knowledge on CSS and vue, need to practice. UI looks barebones, crap styling)</li>
            <li>Better navigation. (Cannot go to play or create from home page)</li>
            <li>Better firebase implementation (firestore rules, firebase code in backend instead)</li>
            <li>Finish up missing features (Cannot cycle to next hand)</li>
            <li>Fix firestore (it broke, cannot update, write or read hands)</li>
        </ul>

        <a href="https://niji-lounge.web.app/">Nijilounge</a>
        <p>Was into vtubers during year 1-2 of university and decided to clone this website called holotools. <br>
        Learned react.js, nodejs. Built a scraper to scrape my youtube account for live livestreams and the frontend uses this data to load iframes
        </p>
        What the app does
        <ul>
            <li>Watch multiple youtube videos in a window</li>
            <li>Show live livestreams, lets user add the youtuber they want to watch</li>
            <li>Dark mode</li>
            <li>Livechat toggle</li>
        </ul>
        What i think i could have done better
        <ul>
            <li>Better backend code so it didnt break. Resorted to using chooks api(which is also gone now)</li>
            <li>Better UI (gain more experience on CSS/mui)</li>
        </ul>
